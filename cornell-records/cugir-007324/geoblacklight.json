  "dc_description_s": "This polygon shapefile represents Euphorbia esula of Leafy Spurge NY for 2000. Leafy spurge is considered an invasive species which displaces native vegetation in prairie habitats and fields. This data set portrays the county-level distribution of Euphorbia esula (common name - leafy spurge) in the United States of America. These data come from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service's PLANTS Database, which is the de facto Federal standard for information about the distribution and nomenclature of U.S. plants. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. The U.S. Geological Survey assumes no responsibility for the use of these data.",
