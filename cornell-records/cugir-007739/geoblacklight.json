  "dc_description_s": "Outer boundary of the New York State Adirondack Park. The data set was hand digitized from 1:24000 scale, 7.5 minute series planimetric, mylar original, New York State Department of Transportation maps. The digitized boundary was edgematched with older planimetric quadrangle delineations being snapped to newer adjacent quadrangles. The boundary was compared to the legal Park description (Environmental Conservation Law Section 9-0101); the \"New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Division of Lands and Forests Adirondack Map\" 1993 edition; a joint DEC/DOT 1:24000 scale mapping project to delineate original allotment lines (patents, townships, tracts, etc.) in Essex, Hamilton, Warren, Washington, and Saratoga Counties; and county Real Property Tax Maps. Where obvious discrepancies occurred, Adirondack Park Agency cartographers re-plotted the boundary at 1:24000 scale using visual reference points on the maps and then re-digitized. Certain sections of the boundary remain in question (see Notes.) Use as a clipping polygon or as a set of arcs delimiting the park.",
