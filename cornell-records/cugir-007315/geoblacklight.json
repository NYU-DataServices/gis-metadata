  "dc_description_s": "This line shapefile represents Hydrography of New York State for 1999. The data set portrays the polygon and line water features of New York State. The file was produced by joining the individual State hydrography layers from the 1:2,000,000- scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data produced by the USGS. This is a revised version of the March 1999 data set. Some small streams, ponds, lakes, and reservoirs cannot be portrayed at this scale. We have associated names to all stream segments and water bodies for which official geographic names were available. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.",
