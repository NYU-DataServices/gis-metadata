This shapefile contains polygons representing the stream basins of the French Creek watershed in western New York. Basins were developed for stream segments at the 1:24,000 scale from 7.5 minute topographic quadrangles. For the purposes of this study, a stream segment is defined as the portion of stream from tributary confluence to tributary confluence. To define the drainage basin for each stream segment.",
