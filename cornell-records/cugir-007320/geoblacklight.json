  "dc_description_s": "This point shapefile represents Major Dams of New York State for 1999. This map layer includes the locations of over 500 majors dams in New York State. The information in the map layer was provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The original dam information came from the National Inventory of Dams (NID) which was produced by USACE in cooperation with FEMA's National Dam Safety Program. The full NID contains over 75,000 dams and is used to track information on the country's water control infrastructure. This data set portrays major dams of New York State. The data set was created by extracting dams 50 feet or more in height, or with a normal storage capacity of 5,000 acre-feet or more, or with a maximum storage capacity of 25,000 acre-feet or more, from the 75,187 dams in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers National Inventory of Dams. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.",
