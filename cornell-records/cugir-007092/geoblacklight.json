County subdivisions are the primary divisions of counties and statistically equivalent entities for the reporting of decennial census data. They include census county divisions, census subareas, and minor civil divisions. Each county subdivision is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code in alphabetical order within the state. CUGIR, the Cornell University Geospatial Information Repository, using US Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census data, developed the GIS data set version of 1990 Census TIGER/Line files for New York State. These files were developed to enable a user to see the geographic component from 1990 TIGER/Line Census files along with basic demographic data.",
