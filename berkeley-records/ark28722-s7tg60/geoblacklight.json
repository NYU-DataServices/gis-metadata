The signatories of the California Biodiversity Council joined forces to gather information on thousands of conservation, mitigation and restoration projects being developed and implemented throughout California. The result, the Natural Resource Project Inventory (NRPI), has become a comprehensive electronic database searchable on the Internet. NRPI is an expansion of previous inventories including 1) the Watershed Projects Inventory (WPI), 2) the California Ecological Restoration Projects Inventory (CERPI), and 3) the California Noxious Weed Control Projects Inventory.",
