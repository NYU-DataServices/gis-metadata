This impression (or one like it) without Lt. Bache's soundings north of Indian Inlet was sent me in the autumn to verify & give sailing directions &c &c and, perhaps, more soundings. This sheet has false meridians. They are laid down 2 1/3 minutues too far east, which puts the land [?] much too far west.\" Historic Maps copy 1 has ms. annotations; note in pen in upper margin: Recd. at office 22nd. 3.
